slingr is a C#-based lingr[*1] client library for Mono and .NET.

slingr-radar is a sample "radar" application. It is based on winforms
and won't work on Mac (as NotifyIcon is not supported). For Mac there is
an official Radar tool [*2].

They may be still fragile and may have a few bugs.
Bug reports and patches are welcome.
